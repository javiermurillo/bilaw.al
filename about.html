	<div class="me">
		<p>At best, I am a <span>passionate builder</span>. I build software, companies, communities, and people. I aim to build world-class products that ooze excellence and perfection by imperfection. I work hard to <i>listen</i> and to <i>innovate</i>.</p>
		<p>During my career to date, I have built three startups (two acquired, one funded), built circa. 50 projects, received numerous mentions, attended 3 events & 8 hackathons (and won 2) along with a Dev8D Top Developer award.</p>

		<p>I've built multiplayer games, payment processors, pay to click websites, reverse image search, social quiz app, video search engine, security solutions, mobile-only chatroulette and viral websites. It's nowhere near adequate though, because I've <i>not</i> changed the world. Not one bit. And I won't stop until I do.</p>

		<p>I'm a huge fan of startups. I strongly believe they prosper true innovation amongst talented people; and I hope that I'm fortunate enough to be around great people. Most of all, I hope they make <i>your</i> life easier to live through product excellence.</p>

		<p> Whilst studying for a degree in Computer Science, I mostly travel to see different communities and learn new things. I constantly keep up with the latest and greatest tools to make my life easier. I also spend a lot of time trying to make it easier for other people to learn new things.</p>

		<p>I constantly go to the gym to freshen my mind and maintain myself. I'm always up-to-date with football, but that's because I'm a massive FC Barcelona fan. I'm also exploring meditation to think clearer and smarter as a human.</p>
