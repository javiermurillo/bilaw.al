		<p class="post-h6"><i>At it's most purest, I want to build world-class products and change the world.</i></p>

		<p>I've <i>always</i> been obsessed with having purpose ever since I was a little kid. As much as I appreciate that I could have a very secure five-to-six figure salary at a top technology company building great software, I'm seeking more than that because I want real purpose. I don't just want to keep up the latest and greatest, I want to <i>define</i> it. I focus my career on understanding people, who I highly value as those who will jointly help me achieve my vision; I believe that I can start my vision on my own, but I certainly can't finish it on my own.</p>

		<p>An important part of my vision is that I won't measure the progress of my vision with money. It may seem surprising, but I think it's vitally important for me; it means I can focus less on earning and even lesser on spending on it. Money can take us places, but it still is a fabricated object that, more times than not, disrupts ultimate happiness. I feel that making a strong effort to achieve my vision without focusing on being wealthy, but rather, on the impact of my work. I've learnt more than many that whilst money can free up your freedom, it isn't the meaning of life itself and shouldn't be treated as such.</p>

		<p>My <i>super</i> obsession with excellence is a huge part in my effort to build world-class products. It requires phenemonal magnitudes of focus and a rare obsession with your product; enough to make your life far from normal. World-class expectations presents itself with constant risks, which I actually hunger, purely because it opens up the opportunity to change your product; whether that's better or worse, is purely up to you. I don't want to achieve lucky success, but rather hard efforts of understanding the science behind world-class excellence, so I can constantly meet that expectation for as long as I live.</p>
