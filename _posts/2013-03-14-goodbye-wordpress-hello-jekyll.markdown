Today, I moved my blog from [WordPress](http://wordpress.org) to Amazon S3 by way of [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll); a static-site generator built by [Tom Preston-Werner](http://tom.preston-werner.com). I've long had the idea of building my own static-site generator in PHP, but like most of my ideas, I never get the time to actually execute it. At a recent [SummitAwesome](http://summitawesome.co.uk) hackathon, I suggested the idea; everyone suggested I use Jekyll. I had heard of it earlier, but I wasn't actually sure of what it was. So I spent the last month researching Jekyll, and I took the plunge to which I have to say: I absolutely love it!

Why do I love it? It is perfect by being imperfect. It's not intuitive, but it is simple. It's not popular, but it works great. It took me about 3 hours of using Jekyll to realise why it's perfect. I probably won't ever go back to blogging via WordPress, ever. Why? Because WordPress has become **distracting software**. It's become a CMS (content management system) like Magento, Drupal and Joomla in efforts to gain possible use-cases. It's understandable because that's *where the money is*, but from an open-sourced blogging platform perspective, I don't like it one bit. Most small bloggers don't need 99% of the features. I don't want to manage my content. I don't want to click Install and constantly change my site. It's supposed to make it **easier to blog**. Computationally, it definitely does. But psychologically, it fails in every single aspect. Whilst the former is way more impressive, by far the latter is more important.

Within a couple of hours of using Jekyll, I realised that I've wrote a better post than probably 6 months using WordPress. I remember those times when I had WordPress, and during a spare hour to write a blog post, I had zilch written up. Now I know why: because I was distracted by adding new functionality or trying a new theme. Writing, like many human tasks, need **isolation for concentration**. We already have the [same attention span as a goldfish](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/1834682.stm), and it's not getting any better. I would avoid any possible distractions unless it's **really** (x 10&#94;10) necessary.

I think with that in mind, static-site generators like Jekyll will surge in popularity. JavaScript and CSS3 progressments have substituted any server-side features such as commenting ([Disqus](http://disqus.com), [Livefyre](http://livefyre.com), [Facebook Comments](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/plugins/comments/), etc.) and analytics ([Google Analytics](http://analytics.google.com), [GoSquared](http://gosquared.com), [Mixpanel](http://mixpanel.com), etc.) to name a few. The benefits of [Amazon S3](http://aws.amazon.com/s3/) (or [GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com)) is pay-as-you-go pricing (or 100% free with GitHub Pages), infinitely scalable, fast loading speeds, better uptime, simpler to maintain and of course -- more productive in your blogging!

Even though I'm new to Jekyll, I have instanteously felt its psychological benefits. Even software like [iA Writer](http://informationarchitects.net) has done my attention span lots of good. You'll be surprised by how much more you work on your content when **it is not possible** to be distracted by software.
